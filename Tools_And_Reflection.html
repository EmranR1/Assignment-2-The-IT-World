    <h2>How well the audit trails on github/google docs reflects group work:</h2>
      <p>The audit trails on github and other evidence on google docs reflects the group work very well. The people who contributed can be clearly seen and their efforts are clearly shown and the people who have not done much clearly don’t show much signs of audit trails neither on github or Google docs or Microsoft teams.

     <h2>Reflecting as a group</h2>
      <p>Overall the whole project went well enough, however we could improve communication (see Teams for some not completely concise notes and decisions). However much of the communication was adequate (see Teams for understandable and inferred notes and decisions). It was surprising the amount of work as opposed to the difficulty of the work, by which we mean that time management played a much larger role than anticipated. We learned from working in a group that I dislike a focus on the group as opposed to the project. At times it seemed that there was more work organizing than there was work writing, however this was not always the case. The project management was quite stressful at times and completely clear deadlines coupled with organisation in advance would solve this.

    <h2>What Emran has done 40%</h2>
      <p>What I have done: I was the presenter of all our meetings, I set up all our meetings exactly when they should have been. I also set up each section on google docs. Research information on two IT professionals via Youtube using two videos for each professional = 4, Cloud Architect and Cybersecurity Analyst. Essentially all of github html coding. Research on autonomous vehicles. All of the project section. Added links like “join teams” github repository website and so on. Provided the template of google docs document, organising group’s information. Created career comparison table (Ideal jobs section) fully completed question 1 and 3 (in ideal job section) Contributed little to question 2. Choose the colour and font of the report. Compared Ideal jobs in comparison table. Completed huge majority chunk of Burning glass data comparison of skills for career.Analysed Ideal job with burning glass industry data adding huge chunk of information both group related and individual career related to that section. HTML coding of team profile, tools sections (including writing up agendas, actions, reviewing meeting recordings to confirm details, links to meetings) I also helped discuss formatting of the document with Daniel. In general I also provided the whole template of original rough the report for members to put their information in however Daniel formatted majority of the final report while discussing with me.</p>
    <h2>Emran group reflection</h2>
    <p>Group members like Daniel and myself were able to do the group work individually very well and catch up on meetings as well. We made great progress in the meetings. However Paul was not able to finish his work on the deadline that me and Daniel had finished our work and the deadline which was decided on microsoft teams. This resulted in Paul delaying our whole project due to not completing critical path tasks such as for example putting his ideal job into the tables or doing his research and adding IT technologies and so on the date he was supposed. This resulted in Paul spending most of his time catching up on the last 2 days of the project and even on monday lessons on which the group was focussing on other things. Paul even though behind sometimes was spending time on his laptop like it was his leisure time and that he was not behind at all. He mentions that the communication from the group are not effective. However this is incredibly wrong. As on microsoft teams you are clearly able to see the work that has to be done and EXACTLY when it has to be done by. However Paul not only failed to finish his work on time that was set he also gave immense amount of stress to group members for a project that should have been very relaxed and easy to do. Things that can be improved could be responsibly showing up to meetings. Allocating time to the meeting and not doing anything else at that time. Being a responsible person and finishing the work stated by group members on time. By improving these not only the group can do work without stress and very high standard but there also won’t be any issues with the project. Meeting minutes is a clear evidence of this and can be viewed via the excel “attendance” report that is produced after each meeting on our teams. I asked Paul multiple times for example to upload a bit of visual content to his information and reminded him multiple times with messages on teams but despite that. nothing from him. Paul also claimed he had finished coding the pages into HTML however towards the end of the assignment me and Daniel found out that Paul had coded HTML very inconsistently compared to our other pages and our overall design he had also not input many informations such as key visuals on the pages. Paul also needs to work on controlling himself and his anger and needs to take feedback well and be much more responsible.

      <h2>Daniel Group reflection 34% contribution</h2>
      <p>I helped focus the group and define clear goals during meetings and formatted the report. I researched two IT professionals, Darren Kitchen and Tarah Wheeler. I reviewed and modified portions of the html such as ensuring the functionality of the top screen links. I researched arduinos, raspberry pis and makey makeys for the IT technologies section. I summarised my personal profile and outlined how it could be useful to the group. I outlined and wrote most of the comparison of ideal jobs paragraphs. I wrote my ideal job section (penetration testing), including the skills related to the burning glass data (ideal job and industry data are integrated into one section). I also wrote this reflection. <p> I worked well with Paul and quite well with Emran, however communication overall will be improved before the next phase of this project. Organizational skills will be improved, specifically by having an overview and timeline of the whole project not just the current section. Allocating tasks based on each team member's skills should also be considered in future, as it would decrease some stress and, by increasing confidence, increase work quality.

        <h2>Paul Group reflection 40%</h2>
      <p>My Group reflection. I had set up the google drive, 2 reports on IT Technologies Cyber security and cloud computing as well as the profile, IT professional and industry on a cyber security analyst. Formatted the document. I worked very well with Daniel although he wasn't there every class he effectively communicated and contributed well. I created 5 index, project, ideal jobs, it-work html pages and a navigation as well as some inbuilt css font sizing for consistency. Created a style sheet and linked it to the pages. I created my own version of the projects page following the w3c standards. The page emran made had major issues and was using <dd> <dl> tags instead of <p> tags. There was also no h2 tags for hierarchy or structure of the html doc, also all inbuilt css on the whole thing which was making it super unreadable however i made a cleaner version but emran got butthurt and deleted it. I helped the most I could. I also had to fix up his whole document because he did not close his h2 tags and was blaming me for apparently ruining his work haha He does not understand how html works nor standards. I have a diploma of IT, am qualified in html and did my best to create the rest of the pages as they were clearly struggling and it is a time sensitive issue due to the due date being soon. There also weren't any communication that we were starting a meeting and at one point emran had a meeting by himself which was strange. I don't usually like to write negative things but after reading his above reflection which is totally untrue and hilarious this is clarification. For the last meeting I recently got a pc and had no mic or camera so i did my best to type and communicate via chat. Hopefully we can improve communication for the next assignment and collaborate more efficiently with a much more structured plan and increase productivity as rushing last week's work wasn't ideal.
