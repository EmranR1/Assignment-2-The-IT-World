    <dd style="font-family:'Courier New'">Emran Radfar: My name is Emran Radfar my student number is s3894684, I was born in Iran, Tehran but grew up in Australia. I really love chilling and playing games like Witcher 3 or any amazing single player game (yes even Cyberpunk 2077) I have a very good gaming PC with a RTX 3070 GPU and Ryzen 5600xt CPU I love running my games on max graphics (If I can ever get to play again). I am also really interested in Cybersecurity. I have done software development as a VCE subject in high school which was kind of fun to do as we got to build our own software.
