    <dd style="font-family:'Courier New'">Emran Radfar: My name is Emran Radfar my student number is s3894684, I was born in Iran, Tehran but grew up in Australia. I really love chilling and playing games like Witcher 3 or any amazing single player game (yes even Cyberpunk 2077) I have a very good gaming PC with a RTX 3070 GPU and Ryzen 5600xt CPU I love running my games on max graphics (If I can ever get to play again). I am also really interested in Cybersecurity. I have done software development as a VCE subject in high school which was kind of fun to do as we got to build our own software.

    <dd style="font-family:'Courier New'">Daniel Rhodes Hindmarsh: My name is Daniel Rhodes Hindmarsh, student number S3906625. Over here is the photo on my student ID. Although I was born near Devon Meadows Australia, my parents immigrated over from Essex, England in 1995. Overall, I’d call myself Australian with a small patriotic streak for England, it’s superior sweets and chip butties. My interest in IT stems from my want to understand how the things around me work. Computers and software are extremely complicated and I only understand the basics of how they work, as such I find them exceedingly interesting.
