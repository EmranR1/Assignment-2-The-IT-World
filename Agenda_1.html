<h1>Agenda 1</h1>
    <p>Getting everyone who hasn't started yet started to start working. Allocating work such as team profile, job summary and basic website. Comparison of our ideal jobs, telling members who have not added their ideal job yet to add it so we can compare our ideal jobs. Emran tells members about the github repository that he has set up and makes sure they know they were invited and should join.</p>
