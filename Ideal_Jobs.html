<h1><strong>Ideal Jobs&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Comparison of ideal jobs:</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber security specialist, Cybersecurity analyst and Penetration tester are all cyber security focused. Cyber security specialists and Cybersecurity analysts have very similar responsibilities. Penetration testing is also in the Cybersecurity field. These roles all have very high pay, with a cybersecurity specialist being the highest with over +100k salary in the long term. Some of these &ldquo;ideal jobs&rdquo; are actually merely entry level jobs, however they do have a very impressive salary which almost competes with the +100k salary of cybersecurity specialists. This is really good as cybersecurity specialists require tons of experience in many of these fields to be able to work as a cybersecurity specialist.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where a cyber security specialist may provide a variety of cyber security services such as monitoring and investigating systems and maintaining security. A cyber security analyst might work on reports of existing systems and system ideas, to create recommendations to a company on how to improve and&nbsp; secure their system and business from potential exploits / attacks. Penetration testing is about the application of cyber security analytics, through testing of security systems.In this way, all of these jobs are related with slightly different specialties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber security specialist is a late stage career job with many years of experience required. Cyber security analyst and penetration testing meanwhile require some experience in IT, but can lead to many other jobs.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Daniel&rsquo;s Ideal Job:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Penetration testing is a growing field, with an expected 47,300 ICT employees by 2023. Security related jobs are not on the burning glass top titles job list 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General skills like problem solving, communication and ability to learn are essential in these jobs. As are organisation, teamwork, report writing, planning, research, analytical skills and decision making. However more specifically computer skills are a requirement. Programming languages are very useful to know but can depend on the specific job, for example html, css and sql are all useful languages if a website were to be part of a more digital. On the other hand skills like lock picking and social engineering are useful for more physical penetration testing jobs. Capgemini for example requires basic understanding of AWS and Azure cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) knowledge of deploying Security tools in cloud environment and Good written &amp; verbal communication skills among other things. &nbsp; Generally due to the variety of possible jobs, penetration testing can require a large skillset, but can still be accomplished with a smaller one. In general, programming languages of varying kinds, windows and linux skills and systems engineering skills are required and useful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skills used can be learned and used from a variety of places in a variety of ways. Windows PowerShell for example can be used to assist a system administrator in remotely managing company computers, however it can equally be used to steal data from an unsuspecting computer. Overall it is safe to say that all of the skills used as a penetration tester could equally be used in a variety of other IT related jobs, as such the demand for their skills is high for general IT positions and especially high for information security positions. The general communication, self learning and problem solving skills are sought out by many employers. They can be simplified to initiative and personable skills, which are required for many jobs, meaning from a non-IT related skill set these skills are fit for almost any job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top three IT related skills that aren&rsquo;t required for penetration testers are business management, project management and graphic design. The top three generic skills that aren&rsquo;t required for penetration testers are troubleshooting, creativity and leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After looking at the burning glass data, I would still want to be a penetration tester because it is a job that covers a wide variety of topics, is paid on commission most of the time and relates to cyber security which is my interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Demand For IT Specific Skills:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SQL is the most popular skill in the IT industry followed up by JavaScript and Java, this is followed by some basic operating system skills for Microsoft windows and Linux. Some basic communication skills to build relationships with customers or co-workers, and lastly ITIL, GIT and Python are the bottom 3. which is very unfortunate as we are learning Python currently and this makes me think that Python is not much of use. However this data is from March 2018 and I assume a lot has changed by then.</span></p>

<p><strong>Demand For General Skills:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communication skills as expected dominates the demand list followed by problem solving and organisational skills which are very basic foundations of any IT career and are very important if you want to have an IT job. Most of these skills are actually learned in University which I am very happy to see. Skills such as "Meeting deadlines", "Team Work/ Collaboration", "Time management", "Problem solving" even writing and analytical skills are everyday life of a University student and clearly they are very useful for IT careers as well.</span></p>

<p><strong>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No my opinion has not changed. My conclusion is that I have to learn many more skills both IT specific and General skills to truly be good at my job and be a IT professional who is wanted and it will take a long time, But I know it will be worth it and it is rewarding to learn these amazing skills to be successful in the career I want.</span></p>

<p><strong>Pauls Ideal Job:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber Security analyst</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a security analyst, the job requires you to protect IT infrastructures (including networks, hardware and software) from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">various</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criminal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">activities, vulnerabilities, exploits and attacks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A cyber security analyst will monitor networks and systems, detect security threats </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">("incidents"),</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">analyze</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaluate</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">alerts,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and report threats, intrusion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempts,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and false aler</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ts through</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">resolution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">escalation</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">based</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on severity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The analysts job is to basically overlook an organisations system and analyse the system and vind issues and vulnerabilities that need to be addressed and fixed up. The analyst will provide a report to the organisation and provide them with solutions to patch the holes in the system to ensure maximum security and that data redundancy and leakage is minimised. Making sure that the system is secure against malicious attacks from third parties that aim to cause havoc on the system with a variety of methods and attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some very important technical&nbsp; skills that a cyber security analyst has are Reverse engineering. To fix bugs and perform malware analysis, security analysts must disassemble the code and evaluate the software. Another important skill is Application design and understanding how the UI can be exploited, Security analysts must create security architectures and interfaces within the application and test them throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure that the system is secure and to minimise data breaches, loss and redundancy. Another important technical skill an analyst must have is Firewall management. Security analysts must install and maintain firewalls to filter incoming traffic and keep track of access to the organization's computer network ensuring there are no untrustworthy mac addresses connected to the network for example. This requires a thorough understanding of the hardware and software firewall mechanisms and infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyber security Analysts statistics. Referencing A1. cybersecurity jobs are among the most rapidly growing career areas. It is predicted that cybersecurity jobs will grow 31% through 2029, which is over seven times faster than the average economic job growth of 4%. With a constantly evolving industry with more and more security vulnerabilities arising every day there will be no shortage of jobs in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After looking at the burning glass data I would definitely still want to be a cyber security analyst some skills that are not technical include project management and time management which is crucial as most issues would need to be found quickly as it is a time sensitive matter. The job growth for this industry looks secure and ideal and i am excited to learn more about it and one day work in this field.</span></p>
