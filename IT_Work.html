<p><strong>Darren kitchen</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darren kitchen founded, hosts and produces the hacking and computer security show Hak5, is the author of several books related to hacking such as &lsquo;USB Rubber Ducky: A Guide to Keystroke InjectionAttacks&rsquo; (credit ebook) and creator and co-creator of a variety of hacking tools such as the USB Rubber Ducky. Kitchen&rsquo;s work mainly relates to hacking and computer security, be it as a developer or public image.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen&rsquo;s interactions tend to be with the general public through Hak5 and social media, although his target audience is more specifically those with interests in computers. He does also however sell a variety of hacking related items through Hak5 to customers, and interacts with other computer security specialists to create these items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitchen spends a large amount of time hosting Hak5, however as of February he has been hacking across Europe meeting fans. As his job relates to creating content and he has a team working with him, his workload varies over time and he can choose to work more or less depending on this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Kitchen, the difficulties he faces now as a public image in the tech space are related more to keeping up with new hacking innovations, and ensuring&nbsp; the accuracy of the information he provides. Although he is not currently working on any public projects, it can be seen that a great deal of effort has been put into projects such as the wifi pineapple and packet squirrel. It could be argued that this is the most difficult part of his job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Tarah Wheeler:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarah Wheeler is an information security researcher, along with a fellow in New America&rsquo;s Cybersecurity Initiative. She has worked a variety of job positions in the past including Cyber Project Fellow, Chief Information Security Officer &amp; vCISO Advisor, Head of Offensive Security &amp; Technical Data Privacy, Systems Architect as well as authored books such as </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Women In Tech: Take Your Career To The Next Level With Inspiring Stories And Practical Advice&rsquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and interviewed by media outlets such as the Washington post. From this it can be seen that her work relates to information security and its protection. She advises companies on digital security measures, researches new and existing security vulnerabilities to develop better security systems, spreads public awareness of digital safety and taught new and existing information security students. Her latest work is on a international cybersecurity capacity building project, which is similar to what she has done in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheeler interacts with a variety of people. From her students when teaching or working on projects to other IT professionals when doing research. The people she interacts with can also depend on her target audience, if she has one for a specific project, such as women in her book </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&lsquo;Women In Tech: Take Your Career To The Next Level With Inspiring Stories And Practical Advice&rsquo; </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">or the general public when interviewed about day to day security</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">She doesn&rsquo;t usually have clients as she does not offer services so much as employment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her current project has her reviewing and developing foreign policies of cyber security in an effort to deescalate and prevent cyber warfare. As part of this a large amount of her time is spent meeting with foreign countries&rsquo; governments to discuss policy and future plans. Primarily based in America, and due to the current climate of world safety, it can be assumed that much of this is online rather than in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most challenging aspect of her position stems from the mix of politics and information security. Despite her background in both the crossover can be challenging, as different countries has different views on information security, and potentially different goals as a result. Improving policy while maintaining functionality to the implementation is a large challenge.</span></p>

  <h2><strong>Paul&rsquo;s IT Professionals:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Network Engineer</strong></p>

<p><strong>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Network engineers</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are technical experts who specialise in configuring computer networks, maintaining them, and providing technical support and insuring that the network is optimized and functioning as intended. They are the &ldquo;Bread and butter&rdquo; of IT professionals when it comes to networks and connections. They troubleshoot a lot of problems by analysing a clients network to find vulnerabilities or issues that need to be addressed such as an unopened port that can be exploited or a router that is assigning the wrong DHCP range for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the main duties a network engineer is responsible for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining computer networks,&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining hardware,&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upgrading software and related systems</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disaster recover and ensuring data is protected</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replacing and upgrading faulty network hardware components&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are part of an organisation Information and Technology team, Network Engineers work very closely alongside Business Analysts, Network Architects and IT Managers. The network engineer is the specialist when it comes to setting up and maintaining networks, they ensure that everything is up to date and up and running. There networking analytical skills are very important for providing valuable information and reports to the other sections where they do not have as much of a comprehensive understanding of the science behind the network.</span></p>
<p><strong>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generallythey spend most of there time on a computer with administrative privileges they are able to change, fix and upgrade many features of the network from there desk or even troubleshooting problems which can be very time consuming. However they need to sometimes lift heavy items like servers or plug in cables to routers or computers etc for example ethernet cables or other technical skills that will effect the network.they even spend a lot of there time in a even a server room of an organisation, if they are doing a server upgrade</span></p>
<p><strong>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintenance on the production network can be the most challenging as networkchuck stated that the network can involve a lot of trouble shooting and sometimes the problem may take longer than usual and not go as planned. Staying up for hours and doing a lot of overtime as you cant just call a specialist to fix it. The network engineer is the specialist so they are the backbone of the organization when it comes to the network and connections. They are essential and sometimes they have to put a lot of work in to get things back up and running as soon as possible as time is money for an organization. A challenging think in this network field is troubleshooting and a lot of it. Also networking is constantly evolving so the networks engineers have to constantly stay up to date on the procedures and protocols which can be very time consuming constantly learning whilst working.</span></p>
